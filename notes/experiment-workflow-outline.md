# Experiment Workflow

## Overview

Use the outline/workflow to put structure around the experiment. Use the outline to document information about each phase. 

* document findings and information about each of the areas
* document the execution phase
  * use Git to commit and create snapshots of work sequentially (use for easier documentation of process)


## Viability

* Understand objective
* Determine Scope
  * time frame
  * deliverables
  * deliverable target date
* Determine tools and resource requirements
  * are the required tools available?
  * are the required resources available?
  * what do you already have?
* Determine what you know
  * what do you have to learn (new)?
* Determine what you do **not** know
  * are there any risks?

## Initial Research

* Research and learn capabilities of new frameworks
  * Auth0
  * Firebase Cloud Messaging
* Document location and types of resources
  * use as reference
  * use to provide audience with more detailed information

## Ideation of Concept

* Brainstorm/ideation of proof-of-concept application that will fulfill the objective and requirements within the specified scope
  * Rank each idea based on criteria
* Create a *persona* of the target audience and/or individual
* Ideas on ways to engage the target audience for the specified experiment

## Content Plan

* Create outline draft
* Review outline with team

## Plan of Execution

* Create high-level plan of execution for the experiment.
  * sequence or order of items
* Provide initial estimation of work
  * determine what item/feature is in/out of scope based on:
    * completion target
    * level of need for deliverable
    * risk
    * time to complete

## Technical Execution

* Create/establish work environment
  * setup repository
  * setup solution/project for code and resources
  * establish centralized environment for `continuous` deployment
* Setup Notes/Documentation artifacts
  * repository
  * documents
* Implement End-to-End
  * Integrate a small element of all features/frameworks as a `tracer-bullet` to enable a working stack of all the technologies involved
* Implement Features
* Review work progress with team
  * Solicit feedback and suggestions
* Deploy to centralized environment for review

## Content Execution

* Add details
  * use draft outline
  * determine what level of detail to provide
    * images
    * code snippets
* Review content periodically with team (on-going)
  * feedback on content quality
  * easy to understand/follow?
  * engaging?
  * provides value?
* Add resources
  * Github
  * SDK documentation
  * other resources
  * steps to run the application
* Technical review and test of final content
  * does it work
  * does it match with the working application
